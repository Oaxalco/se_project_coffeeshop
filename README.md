# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I plan to improve this website by setting more and better animations, go through the links( like a link actually following another website. ex:facebook and instagram). I plan to get familar with the roots so I can improve and sharpen my skills.
